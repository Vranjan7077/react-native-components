Among the open-source platforms for react native, Expo is a prominent framework for making universal native apps using React and runs on Android, iOS, and the web. Expo includes a universal runtime and many dominant libraries which makes the developing process easier.

Expo Av is the module for audio and video playback operations in this framework. This library uses audio sound objects and video components for media playback, which share a unified and vital API for the media playback process. The use of these objects and components makes the usage of this library easier and it makes the playback process faster.

Developers are free to use props inside the components as well as to use the API functions. As a plus, this library allows developers to do certain modifications and debugging which makes the developers interesting and popular among most native developers.

As the Expo framework contains ExoPlayer implementation by default, to use the MediaPlayer of the device, you just have to add the media player imports of the relevant OS, to the initial status of the AV object.

## Installation

Using npm:

```shell
expo install expo-av
```


If you have already installed Expo into your React app, you can just install modules from the Expo SDK using expo CLI via the expo install commands.
