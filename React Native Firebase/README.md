React Native Firebase is an open-source library on [GitHub](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase)

React Native Firebase is a collection of React Native modules that links your project to Firebase and its services.

This library uses native Firebase SDKs for both iOS and Android, which are light-weight and use pure JavaScript in connecting to Firebase. 

With the use of API, You will be able to have services like Admob, Analytics, Authentications, cloud services, in-app messaging, push notifications, real-time databases, etc.

This library is feature-rich, well tested, and well-typed as well as a well-documented Firebase implementation for React Native. 

As this is very similar to the Firebase Web SDK, the re-usability of the code in cross-platform development is maximized.

To use this library, add a new application in the Firebase console, with the exact package name as in your project’s Manifest file or with the exact iOS bundle ID as in your local project bundle ID. This should be done first before using the other Firebase services.
