Modern mobile applications often contain features that use device sensors and it’s data to perform certain functions. 

Most of the sensors record data such as device orientation, temperature detection, light density detection, the position with respect to the x,y, and z axes, etc.

React Native Sensors is a library of React Native community, to access the data from the device sensors, through your cross-platform mobile app.

This developer-friendly approach makes accessing Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer, and Barometer data easy, faster and in a reactive way, without using another framework or a third-party platform.

The sensor data is accessible through an RxJS Observable and through that, you can have full control of the data.

It is a open-source and ready to use available on [Github](https://github.com/react-native-sensors/react-native-sensors)



## Installation

Using npm:

```shell
npm install react-native-sensors –save
